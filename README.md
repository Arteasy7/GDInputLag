# awesome mod
i was gonna bundle another much more complicated mod with this but it was taking too long to make so i'm just releasing this one on its own for now. removes the extra 1 frame of input lag from the game geometry dash, also gives a menu to toggle it on/off when used with mega hack.

make sure you have MinHook.x86.dll in your GD folder, if not then download this zip and use the MinHook.x86.dll from the bin folder https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/releases/download/v1.3.3/MinHook_133_bin.zip
